# Fault detection on real flight data using machine learning 

<!-- 
Requires the "pprz_data" class to read and extract the paparazzi log files
Get it from the below reprository: 
git clone https://github.com/mrtbrnz/pprz_data 
pip3 install .
 -->

## Read the Paper
You can reach the paper from [this link.](https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03018053)

## Quick-Start
First clone the git repository :

``` git clone --recursive https://github.com/mrtbrnz/fault_detection.git```

Make sure that the pprz_data submodule is also cloned !
Then go into the pprz_data folder and install it :

``` cd pprz_data && pip3 install . ```

Now you can replicate the presented results of the paper by following this [notebook !](https://github.com/mrtbrnz/fault_detection/blob/master/SVM/SVM_implementation_as_in_paper.ipynb) (Make sure to download it to run and use the existing folder tree in order to load the flight data without issues.)
